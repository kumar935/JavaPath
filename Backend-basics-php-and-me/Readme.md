## Attempting to learn PHP and back-end concepts 
######(main purpose being eventually understanding sessions)

- tutorials, books - too much time taking.
- the magical article/example that'll suddenly make everything clear.

- let's create a simple login php application and make it online using AWS. But I'm not going to do it because. It's going to get swept away by the sloth. Have mini aims. I'm not going to follow through. I keep changing my plans. Try maybe? I'm going to start something and realize it's not what I was looking for and am going to stop. I don't want it bad enough. When I want it bad enough I do it. Android development back in 4th year kind of worked with the whole documentation spree. I can't just spring the feeling of "wanting it badly enough" can't rely on that. What I can do? 

Ok. Create a login app > Need to learn php first > Watch a youtube series > They reteach loops and stuff > Bear through it > Your notes suck > Pencil and rubber, try making better notes don't lose your mind if they aren't perfect.
