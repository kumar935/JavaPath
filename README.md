# JavaPath

> My main focus was to learn Spring MVC, so this is more appropriately roadmap for learning spring mvc. Sorry if the title is misleading.

Important stuff I came across while learning Spring MVC.

I already had significant experience in front-end development (Javascript) and android development (So I had some knowledge about java as a language)

So this will probably be useful for those who have similar background.

One can obviously still trudge through, and just troubleshoot wherever they get stuck themselves, and make use of this roadmap.
