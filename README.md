# JavaPath

Here I have documented all the good links that helped me whenever I got stuck while understanding a concept, or say setting up project using a certain framework or just about any silly hitch. I hope this can be helpful to others too.

I already had significant experience in front-end development (Javascript) and android development (So I had some knowledge about java as a language). So I may have skipped some concepts that were already obvious to me. One can obviously still trudge through, and just troubleshoot wherever they get stuck themselves, and make use of this roadmap.
